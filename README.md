Tech stack used: html , css , js , bootstrap , firebase


There are 4 html pages : registration form , home page , user-profile page and t&c page(nothing major in it).

3 css pages for each html pages except last one for styling each one.

The registration page is mainly made of bootstap and css is written to override some of the stylings of the bootstarp and a js file containing firebase authentication code and some features for the page. Users can sign up & log in with email and password and will be redirected to home page where they can furthur proceed.

Home page and User-profile page are mainly html and css as i was not able to implement the firebase database and storage services to my page.

The design of both pages(Home page and User-profile page ) are inspied by a template found by me on youtube but they are not exact copy.

Home page  and  User-profile page were expected to show posts made by user but the feature can be implemented by me till now.

In the Home page there is a photo option on which file dialog will open to uplaod images to firebase storage and shown on the feed and a textarea to write tags but not completed.

On clicking user icon at top right corner a dialog box will appear and see profile option will lead you to user profile page.

In the User-profile page idea was that on clicking the edit profile button a modal popup in which user will fetch their details which will store at firebase database and shown on the profile but feature is not completed yet too.
